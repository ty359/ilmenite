## What Is Ilmenite

Ilmenite is a town-building game with a relatively high DOF. Players can build and develop towns in a 3D sanbox world made up with blocks.
It is developed by a team led by the great young computer scientist Ye D.P. Tao(ID:__ty), using Unity game engine.

## Game Features

You are a leader among a group of villagers. Your goal is to develop your village to make it become a town and even a large city. Your strength and ability is limited so you are not able to fulfill it alone. Instead, you should make full use of your villagers' specialty to explore the world, gather natural resources, build houses and facilities, exploit the terrian(by building a dam over a river etc.), and interact with other non-villager characters(by trading with the merchants passing by etc.). When your town expands, you may also have to construct fortifications to defend the possible invasion of hostile tribes.

Just fire your imagination and creativity, and build your El Dorado now!
